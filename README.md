## Hi there, I'm Trevor 👋

I am an Information Security bachelors student and U.S. Air Force Veteran with a focus on Security Operations, Endpoint Systems, Virtual Machines, and Risk Management. 

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Security at the University of Richmond, I specialize in simulating production environments to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on knowledge using VMware to simulate my Homelabs.

I am working toward a career in IT as an Systems Administrator, Endpoint Analyst, IAM Engineer, and other security roles. My current focus is strenghtening my knowledge and foundation through my Homelab VMware projects to gain the experience I lack.
